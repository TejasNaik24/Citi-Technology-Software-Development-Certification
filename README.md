# Citi-Technology-Software-Development-Certificate

My attempt at the Citi Technology Software Development Certificate.

This project includes a simple stock monitoring tool built in Java. It uses the Yahoo Finance API to get live updates of the Dow Jones Industrial Average every 5 seconds and displays the data in a live-updating line graph using JavaFX.
